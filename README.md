For a full list of patch notes, refer to the [Patch Notes](PatchNotes.md) page.

## Installation

The latest version of Enhanced SCDA Online can be found in the [Releases](https://github.com/Joshhhuaaa/EnhancedSCDAOnline/releases) page. Please note that versions of Enhanced SCDA Online are not compatible with the default version of the game or previous Enhanced versions.

### Game Setup

Enhanced SCDA Online comes included with [ThirteenAG's d3d9-wrapper](https://github.com/ThirteenAG/d3d9-wrapper), this wrapper is used to cap the game's frame rate to 60. It is highly recommended to keep it at 60, both movement and aiming can feel worse on higher frame rates.

- Run the game executable, `SCDA_online.exe` in the System folder to begin playing.
- If experiencing an error on startup, try running `DXSETUP.exe` in the `Installers\DirectX` directory.

### Mouse Polling Rate
Many mice now offer polling rates of 1000 Hz or higher. However, in SCDA Online, higher polling rates may cause issues with your mouse aim. If your mouse allows it, try setting the polling rate to 125 Hz through software.

## Playing Online
Ubisoft discontinued Double Agent's servers in June 2016. However, the multiplayer is still playable when using virtual LAN applications. The most common method in the community currently is to use [Radmin VPN](https://www.radmin-vpn.com/). It's easy to set up, and there's no need for account creation.

- Once Radmin VPN is installed, select "Network" > "Join Network." A window will appear, click on the "Gaming Network" tab, and join the `Splinter Cell D. A.` network.
- If you would like to change your username on Radmin VPN, select "System" > "Change Name" or simply double-click your username.

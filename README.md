A major patch for Splinter Cell: Double Agent's Online mode, fixing bugs and exploits while improving gameplay and map balance.

For a full list of patch notes, refer to the [Patch Notes](PatchNotes.md) page.

## Installation
The latest version of Enhanced SCDA Online can be found in the [Releases](https://github.com/Joshhhuaaa/EnhancedSCDAOnline/releases) page. Please note that versions of Enhanced SCDA Online are not compatible with the default version of the game or previous Enhanced versions.

### Game Setup
Enhanced SCDA Online includes [ThirteenAG's d3d9-wrapper](https://github.com/ThirteenAG/d3d9-wrapper), which caps the game's frame rate at 60 FPS. It is highly recommended to keep it at 60, as both movement and aiming can feel worse at higher frame rates. Unfortunately, when SCDA Online has a capped frame rate, you will encounter a bug with endless loading screens. To force the game to load, press `Ctrl+Alt+Delete` during the loading screen, then press `Esc` to begin loading.

- After downloading Enhanced SCDA Online, extract the contents. You will then have an Enhanced SCDA Online folder, which you can place anywhere you like since it's portable.
- Run the game executable, `SCDA_Online.exe` in the System folder to begin playing.
  - If experiencing an error on startup, try running `DXSETUP.exe` in the `Installers\DirectX` directory.
  - If experiencing a crash while loading into the main menu, ensure you have a recording device, such as a microphone or headset, plugged in.

### Mouse Polling Rate
Many mice now offer polling rates of 1000 Hz or higher. However, in SCDA Online, higher polling rates may cause issues with your mouse aim. If your mouse allows it, try setting the polling rate to 125 Hz through software.

## Playing Online
Ubisoft discontinued Double Agent's servers in June 2016. However, the multiplayer is still playable when using virtual LAN applications. The most common method in the community currently is to use [Radmin VPN](https://www.radmin-vpn.com/). It's easy to set up, and there's no need for account creation.

- Once Radmin VPN is installed, select "Network" > "Join Network." A window will appear, click on the "Gaming Network" tab, and join the `Splinter Cell D. A.` network.
- If you would like to change your username on Radmin VPN, select "System" > "Change Name" or simply double-click your username.
